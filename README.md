# Accenture-North-America (Social Buzz Analysis)
I am currently working as a Data Analyst at Accenture, where I collaborate within a larger team, with each member having distinct roles and responsibilities. Our team has recently been assigned a new project for a client named Social Buzz. This opportunity is particularly exciting for me, as I hope to earn a promotion, and it provides a chance to showcase my data analysis and visualization skills.

## Task 1: Project Understanding
My first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short knowledge check before the call. 

####  What To Do?
- Understand the client and business problem at hand.
- Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
- Identify which tasks to focus on as a Data Analyst.


## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling
Identify which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question, Clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis and determine the answer to the client’s business question

The client has sent through:
7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

Requirements gathering
- Data cleaning
- Data modelling

####  What To Do?
Step 1 : So, the first step is to use the  data model provided to identify which datasets will be required to answer business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

Solution: (Data set required)
- Reaction dataset
- Content dataset
- Reaction Types dataset.

NOTE: Popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type. We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score. So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

Step 2: Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data.

What you need to do:
First: Open the three data sets
